# BattleShip (not finished)
Simple yet enjoyable windows battleship game to play on the cmd console. 
Basic ascii interface using windows.h library for colors.
!!!IMPORTANT UPDATE:I'm working on a new version because the previous one was too messy and I decided to start from scratch, the uploaded one is still the old unfinished version.However you can try it and tell me what is wrong if you want, that may help in the new project. Thanks.

I'm a beginner, please take some time to review my code and let me know if there is anything I can do to improve it, I appreciate any piece of advice. Thanks.

NEWS!!
I'm learning to use sfml and may use it for a new and better version of this game, stay tuned.
